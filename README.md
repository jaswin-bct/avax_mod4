# DegenToken Project

DegenToken is an ERC20 token contract deployed on the Avalanche network. This contract serves as a foundational implementation of an ERC20 token, with additional capabilities that encompass token minting, transfers, redemption, and burning.

## Features

- **Minting New Tokens:** Token minting is a privilege held exclusively by the contract owner. New tokens can be generated and allocated to specific accounts based on the owner's discretion.

- **Transferring Tokens:** Token holders can seamlessly transfer their tokens to other addresses within the Avalanche network.

- **Redeeming Tokens:** Token holders possess the ability to "burn" their tokens, exchanging them for in-game store items or other relevant assets.

- **Burning Tokens:** Any token holder has the option to burn their own tokens, eliminating tokens that are no longer relevant or required.

- **Balance Inquiry:** Token holders can promptly verify their token balance at any moment, allowing them to keep track of their holdings and transactions.
